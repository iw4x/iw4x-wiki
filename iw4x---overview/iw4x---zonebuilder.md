<!-- TITLE:IW4x - ZoneBuilder -->

# What is ZoneBuilder
ZoneBuilder is a tool built into IW4x that allows the creation of mods and fastfiles and dumping them to a human-readable format.

# Usage

You can start ZoneBuilder using `zonebuilder.exe` shipped with the [IW4x Rawfiles](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles) or by starting `iw4x.exe` with the `-zonebuilder` argument.

# Working with IW5 assets

[IW5xport](https://github.com/iw4x/iw5x-port) can be used to export/convert IW5 (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011)) assets into a IW4x ZoneBuilder compatible format.

# Porting CoD4 maps to IW4x

IW4x MPU has been created to simplify porting maps from Call of Duty 4 (Modern Warfare) to IW4x by providing an easy to use User Interface on top of [iw3x-port](https://github.com/iw4x/iw3x-port) and ZoneBuilder.

It's available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-map-porting-utility/releases/latest), with instructions provided in the [README](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-map-porting-utility/blob/main/README.md).
