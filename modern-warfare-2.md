<!-- TITLE:Modern Warfare 2 -->

From the [wikipedia article of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2) : *"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a 2009 first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. It is the sixth installment in the Call of Duty series and the direct sequel to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"*

The engine Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 runs on is indissociable from the game itself, so the names "MW2 Engine", "IW4" (Infinity Ward 4), or "Modern Warfare 2" are used interchangeably. The same is true for every Call Of Duty installment, where the engine, derived from a previous game, is used to make a single game being derived again. This means the changes from one Call Of Duty to another often come from a form of iterating development, as the engine mutates over the years.

There are two main branches of the Call Of Duty Engine we will be interested in - the one maintained historically by **Infinity Ward** (IW) and the one maintained by **Treyarch** (T).
Here are the denominations used throughout this wiki:
